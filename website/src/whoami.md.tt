Hi, my name is [% firstname %] and I'm a Linux and electronics enthusiast currently residing in [% location %]; hailing from [% birth_location %].
I'm a Software Engineer at [% cpanel %], where I primarily work in Perl, JavaScript, and Bash.
Prior to my role as a developer, I was a Senior Technical Analyst at cPanel, and an Abuse Specialist & Veteran Technical Analyst for [% knownhost %].

If I'm not working on my Raspberry PI cluster or hacking on some electronics, you might find me out on a run, playing some Titanfall, or at a concert with my wife [% wife %].

::: {#timeline .timeline} :::
At a young age, I developed a strong sense of curiosity thanks to my parents.
My Mom was a high school chemistry teacher, which meant I was regularly carrying out my own experiments in her lab.
My Dad worked as an IT administrator, physics lab technician, and general contractor in his brotherâ€™s construction company.
Whether it was building my own FM radio circuit, creating my first endothermic reaction, or helping frame-up a staircase,
those early experiences fostered a life-long desire to *dissect* things that intrigue me, *understand* things that don't make sense, and *create* anything I dare.

My discovery of Linux was not far from [xkcd-456](https://xkcd.com/456):

Around 2009, I went over to a friends house to find him surrounded by beige boxes that he salvaged from various thrift stores.
He started telling me all about this thing called bitcoin and how he used Linux to mine this new digital currency.
After I got home, I started installing my first Linux distro, Debian Lenny; after which, I didn't sleep for three days straight.
I was enthralled with this new world of Linux and Open Source; also, crying over *xorg* crashing.

In 2011, while working a dead-end job in the mall, repairing iPhones and other consumer electronics, I cam across a job posting for a Linux Technical Analyst at KnownHost.
It was the first time I really saw the potential in my hobby as a full-time job.
I scheduled an interview with enough room to study relentlessly; after all, I almost exclusively used the GUI in Linux.
I managed to snag the job and I couldn't believe it.
It began to dawn on me what Open Source software could mean for me.
All the information/tools I needed to learn, grow, and succeed was available to me; nothing held me back but myself.
Everyday of the first two months of my new Linux job, I came in early to read coworker tickets; I left late to see problems through; I stopped at the coffee shop to study more.
After working at KnownHost for a few years supporting cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin, I moved into an Abuse Specialist role where I helped keep our network clean and stable.

In 2016, an opportunity at cPanel opened up, and I found myself in Texas about two weeks later.
There was no shortage of challenging problems which allowed me to grow rapidly.
Over the course of my first five years, I averaged a promotion per year, exhausting all the technician levels in our Support Department, and moving into a engineering role.
